                <p>
                    For me, Going Seventeen's EGO is one of the most unique concepts they featured. Back in 2020, they released
                    a horror special called "The Tag" where they visited a "haunted house" escape room. In 2021, EGO was released
                    with a complete, film-accented storyline. 
                </p>

                <p> 
                    EGO is filled with suspenseful, mhumorour, and mysterious scenes that I particularly liked. 
                    In this page, I will be highlighting some of my personal favorite scenes.

                <p class="description">
                    This was the very first jumpscare-type situation in this show.
                    When Hoshi watched his partner getting taken away, he stood for a moment before he decided
                    to go inside the locker for some unknown reason. Things took a turn when he stepped out 
                    and made eye contact with the doctor who suddenly stood in front of the door.

                <p class="description">
                    Followed by a sudden slam of the door, Scoups sprang up the stairs before Joshua.
                    Right behind them, the doctor strided slowly which gave a pang of eeriness.

                <p class="description">
                    This was a very funny scene which deserved two different highlights from me.
                    Jeonghan and DK, who were both doubtful of freeing the hostage calling out to them,
                    started asking the man what to do because they were too scared to do anything else.
                    Finally, DK freed the man from his seat.

                <p class="description">
                    After saving the hostage, Jeonghan and DK told the man in two separate occasions to
                    walk ahead of them because "they saved him so he had to be grateful." They even made him open
                    a locker, which was talked about in the clue they got, so whatever was inside would take
                    the hostage instead of them.

                <p class="description">
                    This was the moment when chills ran down my spine. The two were figuring out which key could
                    be used at the exit door but the sudden screech of their previous friend jumped them to freeze. They stared at him
                    in confusion for a while, but let out a disappointed sigh and questions why he had done it. To make things worse,
                    the "hostage" even gracefully opened the door for the doctor to come in and take them.
